You are an expert full-stack web developer and UI designer.  
Build a **modern, mobile-only dark-mode web app** called **Radio Constanța**.

📱 Overview
This app lets users:
1. Listen to **two live radio streams**:
   - Radio Constanța FM → (stream URL will be provided later)
   - Radio Constanța Folclor → (stream URL will be provided later)
2. Read **latest news** automatically gathered from:
   https://www.radioconstanta.ro/articole/stiri/actualitate/

The app will later be wrapped as an Android app, so it must:
- Be **mobile responsive** (portrait view only)
- **Load fast**, with lazy loading and smooth transitions
- Use **modern fonts** (e.g. Inter, SF Pro Display, Roboto)
- Support **dark mode only**, with clean typography and soft contrast
- Have a **minimal bottom tab navigation** (Radio | News)

🎨 Design references
Use the provided design references (attached screenshots):
- Clean layout, soft rounded cards
- Album art / station art in the player
- Modern thin sans-serif fonts
- Minimal gradients, black/dark gray backgrounds

⚙️ Technical details
- Use **React + Tailwind CSS** for the UI
- Use **Vite** as the build system
- Fetch and parse the **latest 20 news** items from the given RSS/HTML source.
  - Each news card: title, short summary, image, publication date
  - Clicking opens a full article view (in-app)
  - Option to "Load more" → shows older news (up to 3 days back)
  - If user wants older news, show a recommendation link:  
    "For older news, visit radioconstanta.ro"

- Radio player:
  - Large cover art area
  - Play / Pause button
  - Station selector (Radio Constanța FM / Folclor)
  - Show stream title and metadata (if available)
  - Use HTML5 `<audio>` element with custom controls
  - Handle buffering/loading states

🏗️ Functional requirements
- No backend — everything client-side.
- Use Fetch API for retrieving news.
- Use React Router for tab navigation.
- Include basic animations (Framer Motion or Tailwind transitions).
- Optimized for mobile (max width ~480px).

🪶 UI style
- Background: #0C0C0C to #1A1A1A gradient
- Text: white with 85–90% opacity
- Accent color: #00BFFF or #0099FF for highlights and buttons
- Use soft shadows and rounded-2xl corners for cards

At the end, include instructions for:
- Running locally (`npm install && npm run dev`)
- Building production version (`npm run build`)
- Wrapping in Android using WebView or Bubblewrap.

Output the **complete React + Tailwind project code**, ready to copy into a folder and run.
I will provide a few images for design reference.
