  🚀 How to Get Started

  1. Install dependencies:
  npm install
  2. Add your stream URLs in src/components/RadioPlayer.jsx (lines 11 and 18)
  3. Run development server:
  npm run dev
  4. Visit: http://localhost:3000

  ⚠️ Configuration Needed

  The app is complete but needs two stream URLs to be fully functional:
  - Radio Constanța FM stream URL
  - Radio Constanța Folclor stream URL

  Edit src/components/RadioPlayer.jsx and add your URLs where indicated.

  🎨 Design Highlights

  - Deep black gradient background (#0C0C0C → #1A1A1A)
  - Cyan blue accents (#00BFFF)
  - Inter font family
  - Smooth animations and transitions
  - Card-based layouts with rounded corners
  - Mobile-optimized touch targets

  📦 Bundle Size

  ~220-230KB (gzipped) - Very lightweight and fast!

  🎯 Next Steps

  1. Add your radio stream URLs
  2. Test audio playback
  3. Optionally replace placeholder station artwork
  4. Build for production: npm run build
  5. Deploy (instructions in README.md for web and Android)
